Hi! This year I set myself the **goal of mastering the C and C++ language**. 
I started learning C on *April 25, 2023*, before that I had 3 years of experience working in Python, Bash and a bit of JS.

In this repository, I want to periodically upload solved tasks that at a certain stage caused me great difficulties and the solution of which brought me a lot of pleasure.

## Descriptions

A list of tasks I liked and short descriptions.

- 03.05.2023 **The sieve of Eratosthenes**. It was not so much difficult to cope with the language as to realize the principle of the algorithm.
- 05.05.2023 **My mini grep function**. Here I wanted to try to figure out how to pass arguments to a file. For example, I took the grep function, which should find the index of the inclusion of a template in a word.
